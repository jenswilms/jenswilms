### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
Techie at heart, business in spirit, philosopher in mind. Driven by curiosity and a desire to change the world, I get people enthusiastic about an idea, connect them and build (tech-oriented) systems that make those ideas happen. I am specialized in organizational culture and seeing the world through human systems of power and influence, but have the luck of being a 13-year old self-taught coder. Having been through the hardships of founding (and failing) a startup, I understand the various aspects of business and can add the most value where multiple disciplines intersect. Now, I am looking for the next best place where I can leave an impact on the world.

## Projects I have worked on 
### THYNK
#### Co-founder & CEO

### Ao Nang Boatservice
I was on a holiday in Krabi, Thailand. What's special about Krabi is all the neighbouring islands that can only be reached by boat. In Krabi, you have one boat service: you have to go to the service desk, say where you want to go and wait until a minimum amount of people show up. After 2 days of long waiting (especially since I was traveling alone), I got fed up with the inefficiency and spent about a day locked up in my hotel room to build a software for them; people could sign up their prefered destination and time and find other popular times.
