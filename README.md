### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
Techie at heart, business in spirit, philosopher in mind. Driven by curiosity and a desire to change the world, I get people enthusiastic about an idea, connect them and build (tech-oriented) systems that make those ideas happen. I am specialized in organizational culture and seeing the world through human systems of power and influence, but have the luck of being a 13-year old self-taught coder. Having been through the hardships of founding (and failing) a startup, I understand the various aspects of business and can add the most value where multiple disciplines intersect. Now, I am looking for the next best place where I can leave an impact on the world.

## Projects I have worked on
